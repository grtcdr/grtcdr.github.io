  This file modifies headings to use increasingly higher indentation
  as a means of improving the readability of manuals and documents
  with deeply-nested sections, the result of which can be illustrated
  as follows:

  1. Section
      ...
      1.1 Subsection
           ...
  2. Section
       ...
