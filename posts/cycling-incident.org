* Cycling incident :experience:

Just today, I went cycling, something I've been meaning to do for a
really long time.

Between university, personal projects, hobbies and relationships, it's
really hard to fit in a time to cycle to clear my mind and head right
through the wind, smelling cold fresh air at high speeds.

The ride was butter smooth, it brought back all the lovely memories
and I was truly enjoying myself.

As I was returning home, I thought it'd be a good idea to stop by
the gas station and pump the tires - they felt a little too
light, but this turned out to be a huge mistake.

Whilst pumping the front tire, I noticed that it wasn't getting any
stiffer... In fact, it was deflating. Turns out the valves are too
small for the garbage air pump they have installed.

Long story short, I had to walk back home like an idiot, while the
tire was squeaking the entire way back.
