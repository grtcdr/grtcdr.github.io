** Reproducing

If for whatever reason, you wish to reproduce this website locally,
the only requirement to do so, is an installation of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].

You can then export each file individually, or make use of my
[[https://grtcdr.github.io/blog/purely-org-site.html][org-publish-project-alist]] configuration which will help you build the
website in its entirety without much hassle.
