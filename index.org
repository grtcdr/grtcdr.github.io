I'm /grtcdr/, a student and open source software developer. I spend a
lot of time tinkering with software, I also enjoy taking my bike out
for a ride, which I do pretty frequently.

Find me on:

* Highlights

I've taken it upon myself to document [[file:depot.org][the various configurations of my computing environment]], a creative project driven by a motivation of converging art with system configuration.

I've begun working on yet another creative project, a [[file:musichronicle.org][chronicle of the artists and albums]] near and dear to me.
 
* Posts

I like to write about things that I find interesting, such as my
toolset, workflow and life experiences.
