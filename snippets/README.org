* =snippets=

The purpose of this directory is to provide the various =.html=
snippets that are automatically prepended/appended to the =.org=
content of the website at *compile time*.

For example, in the /posts/ area of the website, a navigation bar is
displayed above the content, and a footer is displayed at the very
end.

This is done by reading the contents of the snippets and setting them
to either the =:html-preamble= or =:html-postamble= option.

The naming scheme aims to be consistent between the filenames in this
directory and the various project names specified under the
=org-publish-project-alist= variable in [[file:~/projects/grtcdr.tn/publish.el][publish.el]].
