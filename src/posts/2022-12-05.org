Emacs' theming community is by no means large, but that has never
taken away from the diversity nor the quality of their themes. Nimbus,
or more formally =nimbus-theme=, is a theme authored by [[https://www.bytedude.com][Marcin
Swieczkowski]]. I would like to take you on a brief visual journey -
to highlight the aesthetics of this theme, and display it in all of
its glory.

I know, it's /beautiful/.

I'm neither an expert in color nor in visual design, but these colors
are captivating to me. Something about the aesthetic screams: "/Psst
-- hey... Come get some work done, your text editor misses you./".

Were you expecting a detailed analysis - perhaps one rooted in
mathematics - of the intricacies of this theme?... No can do, amigo. -
I will try and win you over, though.

I could look at this all day long, and more so at night!

We have all come to appreciate [[https://protesilaos.com/][Protesilaos Stavrou]]'s keen eye for
detail as well as his great taste, but however elegant =modus-vivendi=
is, it really strains my eyes. Therefore, I've settled on
=modus-operandi= and =nimbus= during the day and night, respectively.

The show's over :)

If you like what you see, please head over to the [[https://github.com/m-cat/nimbus-theme][project's
repository]], that should tell you how you can install and enable it
on your own machine.
