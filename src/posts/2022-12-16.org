#+TITLE: Making the most out of picture-in-picture

Being limited to a single 15' screen, I'm /forced/ to make the most
out of my screen real estate and optimize my window placement game.

Picture-in-picture is a feature whose potential I'd previously never
realized -- until now. I just did a little experiment and I'm quite
satisfied with the results, here's what I'm talking about:

#+begin_export html
<img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/grtcdr/grtcdr.github.io/main/assets/images/sway-pip-rule.png"
     alt="Preview of the picture-in-picture window rule in action.">
#+end_export

To match a picture-in-picture window, we can use the following criterion:

#+name: criterion
#+begin_src conf
[title="Picture-in-Picture"]
#+end_src

My screen resolution is =1920x1080=, so a window size of =500x280= is
pretty sensible.

#+name: resolution-rule
#+begin_src conf
floating enable
resize set height 280
resize set width  500
#+end_src

The least annoying spot where I could place the window is probably the
bottom right corner of the screen.

#+name: position-rule
#+begin_src conf :comments no
#                1920 |    1080
#              -  500 |  -  280
#             ------- | -------
move position    1420       800
#+end_src

I don't want the window to obstruct any text that might come up behind
it, so I'll make it slightly transparent.

#+name: opacity-rule
#+begin_src conf
opacity 0.7
#+end_src

I don't want to see any borders around the window, so I'll disable those.

#+name: border-rule
#+begin_src conf
border none
#+end_src

I want the window to appear on every workspace.

#+name: stickiness-rule
#+begin_src conf
sticky toggle
#+end_src

Let's assemble the individual pieces:

#+begin_src conf :noweb yes :comments no
for_window <<criterion>> {
  <<stickiness-rule>>
  <<resolution-rule>>
  move position 1420 800
  <<opacity-rule>>
  <<border-rule>>
}
#+end_src

Picture-in-picture makes so much more sense now.
