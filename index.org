* Greetings

I'm grtcdr - a student and open source software developer from
Tunisia.

I spend a lot of time tinkering with software, I also enjoy
taking my bike out for a ride, which I do pretty frequently.

* Highlights

I've taken it upon myself to document [[file:dotfiles.org][the various configurations of my
personal computing environment]]. I've put a lot of effort to make it
composable and modular, both for myself, and you, the reader.

What this has taught me is a vital lesson in knowing how to properly
structure my digital life, improving its coherence and extending its
value.
