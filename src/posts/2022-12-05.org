Emacs' theming community is by no means large, but that has never
taken away from the diversity nor the quality of their themes.

Nimbus, or more formally =nimbus-theme=, is a theme authored by [[https://mrcn.ski/][Marcin
Swieczkowski]] and originally inspired by [[https://github.com/jordonbiondo/ample-theme][Ample]]. I would like to take
you on a brief visual journey - to highlight the aesthetics of this
theme and display it in all of its glory.

I know, it's /beautiful/.

I'm neither an expert in color nor in visual design, but these colors
are captivating to me. Something about the aesthetic screams: "/Psst
-- hey buddy... Come get some some work done, your text editor misses
you/".

I don't have a personal preference for the level of contrast a theme
chooses to adopt throughout its colors -- I just mostly go by
"feel". Themes, in my opinion, have to be intuitively beautiful, and
Nimbus is in my opinion a beautifully-crafted mashup of colors.

You know, I could look at this all day long... and even more so at
night!

In case you were wondering, ERC looks magnificent with Nimbus.

/Show's over!/

If you like what you see, head over to the [[https://github.com/m-cat/nimbus-theme][project's repository]] -
it'll tell you how you can install and enable the theme on your own
machine.
