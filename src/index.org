#+description: grtcdr's website and blog.

You’ve reached grtcdr’s personal website, a computer science student
and free software developer. I like to mess around with software and
build small, mostly stupid things. This tiny part of the internet is
where you can read up on some of my interesting projects, findings and
opinions.

Find me on:
