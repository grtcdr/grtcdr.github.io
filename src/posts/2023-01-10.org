Happy new year, folks!

I just released a new package, [[https://github.com/grtcdr/darkman.el][darkman.el]], which integrates [[https://darkman.whynothugo.nl/][Darkman]]
with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

This package allows you to automatically switch the theme according to
the current mode or set an appropriate theme on startup.

Special thanks to Ian Eure whose [[https://emacsconf.org/2022/talks/dbus/][talk in EmacsConf 2022 on the D-Bus
protocol]] helped me immensely in writing this package and
understanding how things are pieced together.

I'd also like to express my appreciation to Hugo Osvaldo Barrera, the
author and maintainer of Darkman which I believe solves the
dark/light-mode transition problem very intelligently.
