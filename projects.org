Here's what I've worked on over the years:

- [[https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina][libmacchina]]: a library providing all kinds of system information.                              *[maintained]*
- [[file:pro/citron.org][citron]]: a lightweight package providing access to system data via on-demand notifications.     *[maintained]*
- [[https://sr.ht/~grtcdr/dyna/][dyna]]: a package that takes the colorscheme of a terminal emulator, and converts it to another. *[maintained]*
- [[https://sr.ht/~grtcdr/paspio/][paspio]]: a lightweight password entropy calculator & library.                                   *[maintained]*
- [[https://github.com/grtcdr/aparato][aparato]]: a library for querying connected PCI devices and a pci.ids parser.                     *[abandoned]*

Please [[file:contact.org][contact]] me if you're willing to take on the challenge of reviving aparato.
