* Structure

This project uses [[file:lisp/+publish.el][a publishing script]], among other modules, to define
the components which are then used to generate the website. Emacs Lisp
files inside the =lisp= directory all share one similarity, the =op=
prefix, a /local/ convention and a reference to the initials of the
=ox-publish= library.

* Setup

Clone the repository and its [[file:.gitmodules][submodules]]:

#+begin_example
git clone --recursive https://github.com/grtcdr/grtcdr.github.io.git grtcdr.tn
#+end_example

* Building

If you wish to reproduce this site locally, the most overarching
dependency is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]. You'll also want to install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/][GNU Make]] to reap
the benefits of the build system in use.

Once you've set that up, you should install this project's development
dependencies. To do that, position yourself at the project root and
run =npm ci=. To build the project, run the =make= command.

* Development

In order to fully utilize the site during development, you should
serve the =public= directory with a web server. This project uses
[[https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve][miniserve]] by default and thus has a recipe to quickly serve the site:

#+begin_src sh
make serve
#+end_src

* Deployment

This site is hosted using the Sourcehut Pages service and utilizes a
[[file:.github/workflows/pages.yml][CI workflow]] to build and deploy the site with every commit made to the
default branch.

* Copying

The content and source code of this site is licensed under the
