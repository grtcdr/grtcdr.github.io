* Preface

The documentation found herein follows the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]]
principle.

It's only possible thanks to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] text editor, and the [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]]
ecosystem.

The documentation does not cover all of my configurations. Hence, I
invite you to [[https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr/dotfiles][browse the repository]] where the rest of my dotfiles
live.

Please note that a small but significant portion of my configurations,
is a mold of what I've read in a blog, seen in a demonstration, or
just adapted from someone else's dotfiles.
