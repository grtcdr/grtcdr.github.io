<h1 class="title">Cycling incident</h1>
</header><p>
Just today, I went cycling, something I've been meaning to do for a
really long time.
</p>

<p>
Between university, personal projects, hobbies and relationships, it's
really hard to fit in a time to cycle to clear my mind and head right
through the wind, smelling cold fresh air at high speeds.
</p>

<p>
The ride was butter smooth, it brought back all the lovely memories
and I was truly enjoying myself.
</p>

<p>
As I was returning home, I thought it'd be a good idea to stop by
the gas station and pump the tires - they felt a little too
light, but this turned out to be a huge mistake.
</p>

<p>
Whilst pumping the front tire, I noticed that it wasn't getting any
stiffer&#x2026; In fact, it was deflating. Turns out the valves are too
small for the garbage air pump they have installed.
</p>

<p>
Long story short, I had to walk back home like an idiot, while the
tire was squeaking the entire way back.
