Yesterday, I released my first ever Emacs Lisp package -- [[https://github.com/grtcdr/liaison][Liaison]]!

Liaison is a tiny little library that generalizes and automates the
process of mapping an HTML document to its corresponding source
document originally written in the Org markup language.

I hope you find it useful - do let me know if you ever include it in
your project as I would love to hear your thoughts.
