#+TITLE: What have you been up to?

- I've been investing a lot of time in Emacs. It's paid off so far,
  both in my personal and academic life. I've released two packages
  recently, [[https://grtcdr.tn/darkman.el][darkman.el]] and [[https://grtcdr.tn/liaison][liaison]], both of which have been an
  absolute blast to write and maintain. Lots of effort is going into
  making this website a good reading experience for you, the
  reader. It's really gratifying to see Lisp code take shape into an
  entire living, breathing project.

- I've gotten very interested in bibliographic systems, like BibTeX,
  and how the scientific community is using them to cite and organize
  the works they use to efficiently conduct their research.

- I've also been going back and editing previous blog posts in an
  effort to relearn the topics and improve them even further.
