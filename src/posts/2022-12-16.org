#+TITLE: Making the most out of picture-in-picture

Being limited to a single 15" screen, I'm /forced/ to make the most
out of my screen real estate and optimize my window placement game.

Picture-in-picture is a feature whose potential I'd previously never
realized -- until now. I just did a little experiment and I'm quite
satisfied with the results.

The idea is to have picture-in-picture windows get automatically
placed in a non-obstructive location, be semi-transparent and appear
in every workspace.

To match a picture-in-picture window, we can use the following criterion:

#+name: criterion
#+begin_src conf
[title="Picture-in-Picture"]
#+end_src

My screen resolution is =1920x1080=, so a window size of =500x280= is
pretty sensible.

#+name: resolution-rule
#+begin_src conf
floating enable
resize set height 280
resize set width  500
#+end_src

I don't want to see any borders around the window, so I'll disable those.

#+name: border-rule
#+begin_src conf
border none
#+end_src

I want the window to appear on every workspace.

#+name: stickiness-rule
#+begin_src conf
sticky toggle
#+end_src

The least annoying spot where I could place the window is probably the
bottom right corner of the screen.

#+name: position-rule
#+begin_src conf :comments no
#               1920    1080
#             -  500  -  280
#             ——————  ——————
move position   1420     800
#+end_src

I don't want the window to obstruct any text that might come up behind
it, so I'll make it slightly transparent.

#+name: opacity-rule
#+begin_src conf
opacity 0.7
#+end_src

Let's assemble the pieces that compose our new window rule and take a
look at the result.

#+begin_src conf :noweb yes :comments no
for_window <<criterion>> {
  <<resolution-rule>>
  <<border-rule>>
  <<stickiness-rule>>
  move position 1420 800
  <<opacity-rule>>
}
#+end_src

Picture-in-picture makes so much more sense now.
