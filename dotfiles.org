* Abstract

Ever since I've transitioned over to Emacs to replace what I feel that Vim
lacked, I've began documenting many aspects of my life.

The following is a list of documented dotfiles, that I hope you may
extract something useful out of.

Feel free to borrow, take, whatever. /Mi casa es su casa./

* Dotfiles

** [[file:rc/sway.html][Sway]]

A concoction of subtlety and elegance, making use of the bear minimum
of software so as to achieve a coherent desktop environment without
one being present.

* Utilities

** [[file:sh/doch.html][doch]]

A bemenu utility that can list and open any HTML/PDF file found within
my =org-directory=.
