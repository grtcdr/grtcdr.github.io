#+TITLE: What have you been up to?

- I'm currently focusing on Emacs in general and Emacs Lisp in
  particular. I've recently released two packages, [[https://grtcdr.tn/darkman.el][darkman.el]] and
  [[https://grtcdr.tn/liaison][liaison]], both of which have been an absolute blast to write and
  maintain.

- I've gotten very interested in bibliographic systems and how the
  scientific community is using them to cite the works which aid them
  during their research.

- I've also been going back and editing previous blog posts in an
  effort to relearn the topics and improve them even further.

- I'm thinking of integrating [[https://bit.dev/][Bit]] (as a development-dependency) with
  this website to reduce the complexity of the project, and also
  because submodules have reached their limits for me.

- I'm trying to learn the ways of [[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]]!
