* Hi there! I'm _grtcdr_.
You might know me as the author of macchina or some other command-line
utility, or maybe we met at a red light at some point?

Anyhow, I'm a 3^rd year student majoring in software engineering and I
mainly work on open source software, making small tools that solve
small problems.

I enjoy long drives, good pasta, and free & open source software. I'm
also really interested in astronomy. So, if you know a guy that knows
a guy that could get me on a spaceship, preferably one that can land
back on Earth, I would really appreciate it :)
