** Setup

Clone the project:

#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/grtcdr/website-org
#+end_example

Import [[https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr/dotfiles][dotfiles submodule]]:

#+begin_example
git submodule update --init
#+end_example

** Reproducing

If for whatever reason, you wish to reproduce this website locally,
the only requirement to do so, is an installation of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].

You can then export each file individually, or make use of my
[[https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr/dotfiles/tree/main/item/emacs/.config/emacs/editor/org.el][org-publish-project-alist]] configuration which will help you build the
website in its entirety without much hassle, provided you modify the
paths of each =:publishing-directory= property accordingly.

** Structure
