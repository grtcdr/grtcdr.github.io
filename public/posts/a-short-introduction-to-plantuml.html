Modeling is the designing of software applications before coding. &#x2013; uml.org

<p>
Many developers believe this is a waste of time, and while I mostly
agree, I certainly see a lot of benefit in abstracting complex systems
through diagrams that even non-programmers can wrap their heads
around.
</p>

<p>
UML is a topic that is still taught in academia, but I don't think
it's taught right. In every academic project I was part of, I've
noticed people misusing UML, or at least, not using it to its full
potential.

When UML is a prerequisite, I choose to use a solution that can be
reproduced by people other than myself. A proprietary format is
likely to change over time, and heavy software is simply a no-go.

Git and all other version control systems favor text.
</p>

<p>
I always <i>sigh</i> when I see projects hosting things that are not
primarily software in a VCS. My first instinct is to yell at the
maintainer for choosing Git, because it's not what Git was designed
for.

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml">PlantUML</a> is human-readable, human-writable and is simply plain text -
this allows your VCS to do its compression magic, which in turn saves
you a non-negligible amount of time. Since it is merely a textual
representation, a language out of which spring visual diagrams, one
can track the changes that occur within the file overtime.

PlantUML, being a text-driven solution, does not face the issues that
plague GUI-driven alternatives, all of which start to break down at
some point. Their UI is usually cluttered with all of the diagrams
they support&#x2026; None of which you'll actually ever use in a real-world
scenario.

I just want to model this system so I can be done with it, dude.

PlantUML automatically integrates with your workflow because you can
literally use it anywhere. You're not limited as to where you write
UML; this allows you to mold the tool into your workflow as you see
fit.

My computing environment is revolved around the philosophy of a
keyboard-centric worfklow. I find that it saves me a lot of time and
energy not having to move my hands beyond the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">home row</a>, and it's
gratifying to jump back and forth between my windows and workspaces at
the speed of light.
</p>

<p>
PlantUML, being text-driven, does not hamper my workflow, rather, it
extends it.

Let's represent the animal kingdom in a class diagram, abstracting it
the objected oriented way.
</p>

<p>
Give this a good read, and then jump to the next section for my explanation.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org4077f2b">
@startuml
package Animalia {

  Animal &lt;|-- Feline
  Animal &lt;|-- Canine

  Feline --&gt; Felidae
  Canine --&gt; Canidae

  abstract class Animal {
     {abstract} void jump(height: int)
     {abstract} void run(velocity: int)
  }
  
  class Feline {
     - species: Enum&lt;Felidae&gt;
     + jump(height: int)
     + run(velocity: int)
  }
  
  class Canine {
     - species: Enum&lt;Canidae&gt;
     + jump(height: int)
     + run(velocity: int)
  }

  enum Felidae {
     Jaguar,
     Lion,
     Cougar
  }
  
  enum Canidae {
     Wolf,
     Fox,
     Dog
  }
}
@enduml
</pre>

<p>
Reading over the syntax, we can see that everything is wrapped inside
<code>@startuml</code> and <code>@enduml</code>, a notation that is required for PlantUML to
recognize its own syntax, kind of like a shebang.
</p>

<p>
Inside the <code>Animalia</code> package, we find two classes, <code>Feline</code> and
<code>Canine</code> which implement the functions defined in <code>Animal</code>, our
abstract class. We've also got two enums, <code>Felidae</code>, and <code>Canidae</code>,
which hold as many species of the two families as I can possibly think
of.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so how do we tie everything together? You guessed it, with
arrows!
</p>

<p>
We can represent aggregation between two classes with <code>&lt;|--</code> or
<code>--|&gt;</code>, and to represent a normal relationship between two things,
such as what you see between the different enums and classes, we can
use <code>&lt;--</code> or <code>--&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
The direction of the pointy bit matters, and it will be reflected <b>as
is</b>, in the <a href="#org4327339">output diagram</a>.
</p>

<p>
The last thing I'll cover is access modifiers, all of which are
assigned a unique icon by PlantUML. Prepending a method or attribute
with a <code>+</code> will indicate that it's <code>public</code> &#x2013; <code>-</code> is private &#x2013; <code>#</code> is
protected and <code>~</code> is package private. It's sort of your responsibility
to use them appropriately, as PlantUML won't stop you from shooting
yourself in the foot.
</p>

<p>
Dying to compile it? Pop your terminal open, and give this command a
go.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">plantuml animalia.uml -tpng animalia.png
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If all goes smoothly, you should see an <code>animalia.png</code> file appear in
your working directory&#x2026; Go on, open it!
</p>

<p>
I hope I've given PlantUML the proper introduction it deserves - it's a
pretty neat program, don't you think?
