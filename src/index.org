#+TITLE: Greetings
#+DESCRIPTION: grtcdr's website and blog.

I'm /grtcdr/, a student and [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html][free software]] developer. I spend a lot of
time tinkering with software, I also enjoy taking my bike out for a
ride, something I /(used to)/ do pretty frequently - I need to start
doing that again.

Find me on:
