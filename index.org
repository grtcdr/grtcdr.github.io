* Hi there! I'm grtcdr.

I know, what a terrible name... You can call me /"great crowd"/.

You might know me as the author of macchina, or maybe we met on the
train?

I'm a 3^rd year student majoring in software engineering. I mainly work
on open source software.

I enjoy minimal web pages, so this abomination that you're looking at
right now, might stay forever. Your browser loves this website.
