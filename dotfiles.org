* Preface
Ever since I had transitioned over to Emacs to obtain what (I felt)
Vim could not offer, I have taken an immense effort to dive deep into
unknown territories, explore new concepts, and make the editor truly
work for me. I had later stumbled upon [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]]. And you
know what? I am convinced, for the most part.

I had later begun documenting many aspects of my day-to-day life, this
[[https://github.com/grtcdr/website-org][website]] and the documentation found herein is purely a result of the
hard work of others who have driven this philosophy forward. I am
grateful that Emacs adopts it in such flexible and unique manner. I
suppose this is the advantage of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]] in general, and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] in
particular.

The documentation does not cover everything I use, yet. So, I invite
you to [[https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr/dotfiles][browse the repository]] where the rest of my dotfiles live.

Please note that a small but significant portion of my configurations,
is a mold of what I've read in a blog, seen in a demonstration, or
just adapted from someone else's dotfiles.

You are *free* to use, modify, or do anything with any of the material
you may find therein â€” /Mi casa es su casa./
