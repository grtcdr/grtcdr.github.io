#+TITLE: Bonjour
#+SETUPFILE: _setup.org

I'm /grtcdr/, a student and open source software developer. I spend a
lot of time tinkering with software, I also enjoy taking my bike out
for a ride, which I do pretty frequently.

Find me on:

+ GitHub: [[https://github.com/grtcdr][@grtcdr]]
+ SourceHut: [[https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr][~grtcdr]]

* Highlights

I've taken it upon myself to document [[file:dotfiles.org][the various configurations of my
personal computing environment]]. I've put a lot of effort to make it
composable and modular, both for myself, and you - the reader.

* Posts

I like to write about things that I find interesting, such as my
toolset, workflow and life experiences.
