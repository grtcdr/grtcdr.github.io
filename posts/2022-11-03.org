#+TITLE: Announcing Forgecast - an Emacs Lisp package
#+DATE: <2022-11-03 Thu>
#+SETUPFILE: ../setup.org
#+FILETAGS: :emacs:
#+OPTIONS: html-postamble:nil

Yesterday, I released my first ever Emacs Lisp package -- [[https://github.com/grtcdr/forgecast][Forgecast]]!

This minuscule library provides a helper function that enables you to
/automatically/ link arbitrary [[info:org#Summary][Org]] documents to their original
source. It is similar in behavior to the links you find at the end of
[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/][MDN]] articles.

I hope you find it useful - do let me know if you ever include it in
your project as I would love to hear your thoughts.
