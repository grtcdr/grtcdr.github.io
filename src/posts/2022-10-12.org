#+title:    Getting a taste of libvirt hooks

I recently had the pleasure of learning how DNS systems work behind
the scenes through an itsy-bitsy academic project. I learned how to
set one (bind9) up from scratch and stumbled my way through it until I
eventually got the gist of it.

The DNS system in question is installed on a virtual machine (we'll
refer to it as "dumbvm") that I only boot up when I attend certain
classes. Consequently, there are times where the virtual machine is
powered off so I would like it if my /host/ reverted back to the
default nameserver set by our home router.

Fortunately, libvirt has a [[https://libvirt.org/hooks.html][hook system]] in place for us to plug our own
programs into, so let's make libvirt smarter!

VM_NAME=$1
OPER=$2
SUB_OPER=$3

if [ "$VM_NAME" = "dumbvm" ]; then
    if [ "$OPER" = "started" ]; then
	if [ "$SUB_OPER" = "begin" ]; then
	    systemd-resolve --interface=<wlan0> dns --set-dns=<nameserver-ip-addr> --set-domain=<ns.example.com>
	fi
    elif [ "$OPER" = "stopped" ]; then
	if [ "$SUB_OPER" = "end" ]; then
	    systemd-resolve --interface=<wlan0> dns --revert
	fi
    fi
fi
#+end_src
