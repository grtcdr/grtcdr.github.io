- [[https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina][libmacchina]]: a library providing access to all sorts of system information.
- [[file:citron.org][citron]]: system data via on-demand notifications.
- [[https://sr.ht/~grtcdr/paspio/][paspio]]: password entropy calculator & library.
- [[https://sr.ht/~grtcdr/dyna/][dyna]]: convert a colorscheme from one terminal emulator to another.
