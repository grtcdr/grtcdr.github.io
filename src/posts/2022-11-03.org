#+TITLE: Announcing Forgecast - an Emacs Lisp package
#+DATE: <2022-11-03 Thu>
#+FILETAGS: :emacs:

Yesterday, I released my first ever Emacs Lisp package -- [[https://github.com/grtcdr/forgecast][Forgecast]]!

Forgecast is a tiny little library that generalizes and automates the
process of linking an HTML document to its corresponding source
document originally written in the Org markup language.

I hope you find it useful - do let me know if you ever include it in
your project as I would love to hear your thoughts.
