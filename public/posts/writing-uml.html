Modeling is the designing of software applications before coding.

<p>
A lot of developers believe this is a waste of time, and while I
mostly agree, I certainly see a use in abstracting complex systems
through diagrams that non-programmers can wrap their heads around.
</p>

<p>
UML is a topic that is still taught in academia, but I don't think
it's taught right. In every academic project I was part of, I've
noticed people misusing UML, or at least, not using it to its full
potential.

When UML is a prerequisite, I choose to use a solution that can be
reproduced by people other than myself. A proprietary format is
likely to change over time, and heavy software is simply a no-go.

Git and all other version control systems favor text.

I always <i>sigh</i> when I see projects that host things other than
software, my first instinct is to yell at the maintainer for choosing
Git, because it's not what Git was designed for.

PlantUML is human-readable, human-writable and is simply plain text -
this allows your VCS to do its compression magic, which in turn saves
you loads of time. You can always check back with your commit history
to see what had changed, and how the diagram has evolved over time.

PlantUML, being a text-driven solution, does not face the issues that
plague GUI-driven alternatives. I've used multiple UML diagramming
software, and they all break down at some point. Their UI is usually
cluttered with a sea of diagrams, none of which you'll ever use in a
real-world scenario.

PlantUML automatically integrates with your workflow because you can
literally use it anywhere. You're not limited as to where you write
UML; this allows you to mold the tool into your workflow as you see
fit.

My computing environment is revolved around a keyboard-centric
worfklow. I find that it saves me a lot of time not to move around too
much, and it's gratifying to move throughout your desktop quicker than

PlantUML, being text-driven, does not hamper my workflow, rather, it
extends it.

Let's represent the animal kingdom in a class diagram, abstracting it
the objected oriented way.
</p>

<p>
Give this a good read, and then jump to the next section to understand
what everything means.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org20ac8d7">
@startuml
package Animalia {

  Animal &lt;|-- Feline
  Animal &lt;|-- Canine

  Feline --&gt; Felidae
  Canine --&gt; Canidae

  abstract class Animal {
     {abstract} void jump(height: int)
     {abstract} void run(velocity: int)
  }
  
  class Feline {
     - species: Enum&lt;Felidae&gt;
     + jump(height: int)
     + run(velocity: int)
  }
  
  class Canine {
     - species: Enum&lt;Canidae&gt;
     + jump(height: int)
     + run(velocity: int)
  }

  enum Felidae {
     Jaguar,
     Lion,
     Cougar
  }
  
  enum Canidae {
     Wolf,
     Fox,
     Dog
  }
}
@enduml
</pre>

<p>
Reading over the syntax, we can see that everything is wrapped inside
<code>@startuml</code> and <code>@enduml</code>, a notation that is required for PlantUML to
recognize its own syntax, kind of like a shebang.
</p>

<p>
Inside the <code>Animalia</code> package, we find two classes, <code>Feline</code> and
<code>Canine</code> which implement the functions defined in <code>Animal</code>, our
abstract class. We've also got two enums, <code>Felidae</code>, and <code>Canidae</code>,
which hold as many species of the two families as I can possibly think
of.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so how do we tie everything together? You guessed it, with
arrows!
</p>

<p>
We can represent aggregation between two classes with <code>&lt;|--</code> or
<code>--|&gt;</code>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Tip: The direction of the pointy bit will be reflected in the actual
diagram.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can make a simple arrow as can be seen between the enums and
classes, with <code>&lt;--</code> or <code>--&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
The last thing I'll cover is access modifiers, all of which are
assigned a unique icon by PlantUML. Prepending a method or attribute
with a <code>+</code> will indicate that it's <code>public</code> &#x2013; <code>-</code> is private &#x2013; <code>#</code> is
protected and <code>~</code> is package private. It's sort of your responsibility
to use them appropriately, as PlantUML won't stop you from shooting
yourself in the foot.

Dying to compile it? Give this command a go, and pick whatever format you like.

This is a pretty lengthy post, yet it doesn't even come close to
scratching the surface of the offerings of this wonderful tool.
</p>

<p>
I'm truly happy that such a tool exists, because it's always saved me
my sanity and time.
</p>

<p>
Looking for a more general-purpose, but text-driven diagramming piece
of software? Check out <a href="https://graphviz.org">GraphViz</a>. I made use of it in my language
theory course, and used it to draw finite state machines, and it's an
excellent tool for this very use-case.
