I'm /grtcdr/, a student and open source software developer. I spend a
lot of time tinkering with software, I also enjoy taking my bike out
for a ride, which I do pretty frequently.

Find me on:

+ GitHub: [[https://github.com/grtcdr][@grtcdr]]
+ SourceHut: [[https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr][~grtcdr]]

* Highlights

I've taken it upon myself to document [[file:depot.org][the various configurations of my
computing environment]], a creative project driven by a motivation to
converge art with system configuration.
 
* Posts

I like to write about things that I find interesting, such as my
toolset, workflow and life experiences.
