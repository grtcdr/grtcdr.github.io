#+HTML_HEAD: <script src="js/main.js"></script>

I'm /grtcdr/, a student and [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html][free software]] developer. I spend a lot of
time tinkering with software, I also enjoy taking my bike out for a
ride, something I /(used to)/ do pretty frequently - I need to start
doing that again.

Find me on:

+ GitHub: [[https://github.com/grtcdr][@grtcdr]]
+ SourceHut: [[https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr][~grtcdr]]

Also, come hang with me on [[https://joinmastodon.org/][Mastodon]] - just search for @grtcdr@grtcdr.tn.

* Highlights

I've taken it upon myself to document [[file:dotfiles/theindex.org][the various configurations of my
computing environment]], a creative project driven by a motivation to
document the intricacies of system configuration.
 
* Posts

I like to write about things that I find interesting, such as my
toolset, workflow and life experiences.
