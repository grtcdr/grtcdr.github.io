* Hi there! I'm _grtcdr_.
You might know me as the author of macchina or some other command-line
utility, or maybe we met at a red light at some point?

Anyhow, I'm a 3^rd year student majoring in software engineering
and I mainly work on open source software, making small tools that
solve small problems.
