* citron 🍋

[[https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr/citron][citron]] is a lightweight utility that provides system data via
on-demand notifications. It essentially replaces the need for a task
bar, without bringing the whole kit and caboodle.

It is:
+ designed with customization[fn:1] and freedom[fn:2] in mind.
+ environment-agnostic; runs anywhere, on anything.
+ integrates nicely with your desktop via your notification daemon.
+ supports (but does not impose) the use of icon themes.
+ a frontend for [[https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina][libmacchina ↪]].

citron can be installed through cargo, simply run:

#+begin_src 
cargo install citron
#+end_src

An interesting fact about citron is that it's very low on system
resources, compared to your average task bar program. Don't take my
word for it, see for yourself:

[fn:1] Notification content can be customized with special formatters.
[fn:2] Not opinionated; your system, your rules. Bind any of its subcommands to a specific keybinding in your window manager/desktop environment, and voilà!
